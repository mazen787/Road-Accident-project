## Project Overview
This project focuses on analyzing and visualizing accident data to derive meaningful insights. The workflow involved data cleaning, statistical analysis, and advanced visualizations using Python and Power BI.

## Key Steps

### 1. Data Cleaning and Preparation (Python)
- **Duplicate Removal**: Identified and removed duplicate rows to ensure data accuracy.
- **Outlier Detection**: Detected and handled outliers in numerical columns like `Number_of_Casualties`.
- **Data Type Conversion**: Corrected data types for columns such as `Accident Date`.
- **Statistical Analysis**: Performed descriptive analysis to understand the distribution and summary of data.
- **Handling Missing Values**: Filled missing values for columns like `Road_Type` and `Weather_Conditions` using appropriate strategies (e.g., mode).

### 2. Data Modeling and Measures (Power BI)
- **Date Table**: Created a comprehensive date table to enable time-based analysis.
- **Data Modeling**: Established relationships between tables to support interactive visualizations.
- **Measures**:
  - Total number of casualties.
  - Total number of vehicles involved.
  - Total number of accidents.

### 3. Visualization (Power BI)
- **Cards**:
  - Total number of casualties.
  - Total number of vehicles involved.
  - Total number of accidents.

- **KPI Breakdown by Vehicle Type**:
  - Calculated KPIs for cars, buses, motorcycles, vans, and other vehicle types.

- **Pie Charts**:
  1. Comparison of accidents in urban vs. rural areas.
  2. Distribution of accident severity levels (slight, serious, fatal).
  3. Road surface conditions (dry, ice, snow, etc.).

- **Line Chart**:
  - Trend of accidents over months and years.

- **Bar Chart**:
  - Number of accidents by district area.

- **Scatter Plot**:
  - Relationship between light conditions and accident severity.

## Tools Used
- **Python**: For data cleaning, outlier detection, and statistical analysis.
- **Power BI**: For creating visualizations and dashboards.

---

## Insights Derived
- Urban areas experience more accidents compared to rural areas.
- Road surface conditions like ice and snow contribute to accident severity.
- Light conditions significantly influence accident severity levels.
- Accident trends vary across months and years, with seasonal patterns observed.
- District-specific data helps identify high-risk areas for accidents.
